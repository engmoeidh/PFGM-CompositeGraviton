The paper studies the microscopic origin of the tensor sector in the Proto–Field
Gravity Model (PFGM). In PFGM, both the effective spacetime geometry and its
dynamical kinetic term emerge from a single real scalar “proto–field” living on
Minkowski space, via a rank–one disformal composite metric

\[
g^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}[\Phi] = \eta_{\mu\nu} + \alpha\,\partial_\mu\Phi\,\partial_\nu\Phi.
\]

Building on previous work where an Einstein–Hilbert (EH) term and curvature–
squared corrections are induced for this composite metric, the present paper
asks whether the microscopic Hilbert space actually contains a genuine
massless spin–2 excitation that can be identified as a **composite graviton**.

The main results:

- Construction of a composite metric fluctuation operator
  \(h_{\mu\nu}[\Phi] \equiv \delta g^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}[\Phi]\) on
  constant–gradient backgrounds.
- Derivation of its two–point function from the quadratic proto–field action,
  and spin decomposition into the standard projector basis.
- Identification of a massless spin–2 pole with positive residue in the
  transverse–traceless (TT) sector, while scalar admixtures are massive and
  non–ghost.
- Matching of this composite spin–2 mode to the graviton of the induced EH
  effective field theory, including its coupling to the stress–energy tensor.
- Interpretation of the graviton as a **composite bound state** of the single
  scalar proto–field, analogous to vector/tensor mesons in QCD.
