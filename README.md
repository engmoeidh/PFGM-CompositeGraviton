# Proto--Field Gravity V: Emergent Spin--2 Sector and Composite Graviton

This repository contains the LaTeX source and any supporting calculations 
for the paper:

> **Proto--Field Gravity V: Emergent Spin--2 Sector and Composite Graviton**

The goal of this paper is to:
- Construct a composite metric fluctuation operator \( h_{\mu\nu}[\Phi] \) from the proto–field.
- Show that its two-point function contains a genuine **massless spin–2 pole** with the correct tensor projector.
- Demonstrate that the transverse–traceless sector obeys **Einstein-like IR dynamics** sourced by \( T_{\mu\nu} \), consistent with the induced EH term obtained in earlier PFGM papers.

## Layout

- `tex/` — main LaTeX source for the paper.
- `figures/` — figures generated by external scripts (to be added).
- `scripts/` — analysis / plotting / calculation scripts (to be added).
- `data/` — raw and processed data (if needed later).
- `results/` — numerical outputs, tables, and logs (if needed later).
- `notes/` — scratch notes and auxiliary derivations.
- `docs/` — meta-docs such as ChatGPT instruction protocols.

Compilation instructions will be added once the LaTeX toolchain is finalised 
(e.g. `latexmk` or `pdflatex` pipeline).

## Reproducing internal checks

This repository includes simple scripts to regenerate the internal consistency
checks used in the composite-graviton analysis.

To run all checks and regenerate the associated data files:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/PFGM-CompositeGraviton
bash scripts/run_all_checks.sh
This will produce:

These scripts are intended as internal and referee-facing cross-checks of the
analytic results presented in the main text and appendices; they are not
required to compile the LaTeX document.
